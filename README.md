## What I'm aiming for
To make development faster for everyone using Recharts. Eventually I hope we can make the [Storybook Showcase](https://storybook.js.org/showcase/).

## How I'm going to do it
* Rewriting the old recharts.org API docs into Storybook docs format
* Opening Recharts up to the ecosystem of Storybook addons that help you do things like fine-tune responsive layouts or verify accessibility.
* Creating a visual UI library that allows a developer to interact with something visual (it let's them learn more about it).

## Learning resources
If you want to learn more about the component-driven approach that Storybook enables, this [site](https://www.componentdriven.org/) is a good place to start.
If you want a guided tutorial through building a simple application with Storybook in your framework and language, our [tutorials](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/) have your back.
