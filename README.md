## Why we are here
* We'll make development faster for the developers using Recharts in their websites by isolating components.
* The docs site has become outdated, so needs to update it! So why not in the Storybook Docs?
* Opening Recharts up to the ecosystem of Storybook addons that help you do things like fine-tune responsive layouts or verify accessibility.

## Learning resources
