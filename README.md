# Recharts-Storybook

Using this [repo](https://github.com/Nikhil-Kumaran/minimal-reactjs-boilerplate) I created the beginning of our react project.

We had the repository above because recharts is incompatible with the latest version of React (which at the moment of writing is v17)

I then ran the commands:
npm install recharts
npx sb init

To get recharts and storybook into the project.

After the above has happened, I followed along with [this guide](https://dev.to/kouts/deploy-storybook-to-github-pages-3bij) to hookup github pages to the storybook in the repo.
