# Recharts-Storybook

Using this [repo](https://github.com/Nikhil-Kumaran/minimal-reactjs-boilerplate) I created the beginning of our react project.

We had the repository above because recharts is incompatible with the latest version of React (which at the moment of writing is v17)

I then ran the commands:
npm install recharts
npx sb init

To get recharts and storybook into the project.
